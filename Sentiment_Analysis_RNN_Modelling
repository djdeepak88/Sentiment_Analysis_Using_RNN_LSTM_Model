In this project, you'll build your own deep learning model to classify the sentiment of messages from StockTwits, a social network for investors and traders.
Your model will be able to predict if any particular message is positive or negative. From this, you'll be able to generate a signal of the public sentiment for various ticker symbols.

The Dataset comprises of the twits from the StockTwits and each being given a sentiment from -2 to +2.
The task was to train a RNN model on this data to predict the sentiment of a given twit ranging from Negative to Neutral
to Positive Sentiment.

We used a RNN-LSTM Model (2048->1024->5(Output Probability Class)) with LogSoftMax activation function
since we have 5 categories of sentiments to predict on.
The Preprocessing involves removing punctuations, stopwords, numeric words and then tokenize the text
and assign the numerical values to each unique word.
The Sentiments were rescaled from -2 to +2 to 0 to 4.
