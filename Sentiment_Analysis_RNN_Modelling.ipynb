    "## Introduction\n",
    "When deciding the value of a company, it's important to follow the news. For example, a product recall or natural disaster in a company's product chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project,  i have used the posts from the social media site [StockTwits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StockTwits). The community on StockTwits is full of investors, traders, and entrepreneurs. Each message posted is called a Twit. This is similar to Twitter's version of a post, called a Tweet. I have build a NLP (RNN-LSTM) model around these twits that generate a sentiment score.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have collected a  dataset consisting of collection of twits, which are labeled with the respective sentiments. To capture the degree of sentiment, we'll use a five-point scale: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, very positive. Each twit is labeled -2 to 2 in steps of 1, from very negative to very positive respectively. The NLP sentiment analysis model will learn to assign sentiment to twits on its own, using this labeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loading the data from Dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Import Twits \n",
    "### Load Twits Data \n",

    "   'sentiment': 1},\n",
    "   ...\n",

    "\n",
    "The fields represent the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `'message_body'`: The text of the twit.\n",
    "* `'sentiment'`: Sentiment score for the twit, ranges from -2 to 2 in steps of 1, with 0 being neutral.\n",
